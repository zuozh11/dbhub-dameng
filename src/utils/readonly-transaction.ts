/**
 * Shared read-only transaction backstop for the MySQL-family connectors
 * (MySQL, MariaDB), which use identical semantics.
 *
 * Engine-level read-only backstop: run the batch inside a READ ONLY transaction
 * so the server rejects DML writes (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE/REPLACE) that the
 * keyword classifier missed (e.g. function-based writes). Note this does NOT
 * stop DDL: statements like DROP/CREATE perform an implicit COMMIT that ends the
 * read-only transaction first, so DDL escapes. Stacked-DDL payloads
 * (e.g. `SELECT 1--1;DROP TABLE t`) are instead rejected upstream by the
 * read-only classifier, which splits `--`-hidden statements (see
 * scanSingleLineCommentMySQL in sql-parser.ts).
 *
 * TiDB rejects the READ ONLY modifier (see isTiDBVersion), so there we open a
 * plain transaction and always ROLLBACK instead of COMMIT: any DML the
 * classifier missed is discarded rather than persisted, while SELECT results are
 * unaffected.
